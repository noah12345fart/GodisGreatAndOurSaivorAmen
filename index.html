<h2>what changed my perspective</h2>
when  i was camping i was watching youtube shorts and i came across a video
and it was life changing. it was about God and then i kept seeing videos about god
and i slowly became more faithful and one day i said to my sister "can i use your bible" and she said "yes"
i read revaltion first i learned things about what i was scared of and what they were talking about on youtube shorts.
and then now im not scared im gonna be very happy and i have faith that god comes back and saves us and i will be very happy.
